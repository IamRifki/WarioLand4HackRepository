        "description": "this is a level to test the final boss room, if the level was longer. it was also a test to show how the chests interact if they're not in their original places and moved else where, which seems to only show their original chest animations positions, and not where the new chests are. as soon as the animation ends, i notice that the new chest locations no longer show the chest itself, which i find interesting. playing the boss itself, definitely changes the difficulty of the final boss in each stage, depending on how you succeed each stage. the first stage, sometimes you're having to chase down the 3rd or 4th mask and trying to make timed jumps. 2nd phase is, personally, the most difficult stage. there is a strategy for each thrown item, but i wont tell you :smirk:. I haven't gotten to the last stage yet, but I think it might be the easiest stage, because you dont have to jump over spikes as much as the original. Due to it's difficulty, I extended the time to about 10 minutes to all :Normal:, :Hard:, & :SHard:. If you want to challenge yourself, reduce the time in the maker. NOTE: In order to try out the level, you must have access to the Golden Passage.",
